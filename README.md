**Biograph**

I am currently a doctoral student at the Division of Decision and Control Systems in Royal institute of technology (KTH), under the supervision of Dimos Dimarogonas.  I received the [B.Sc](http://b.sc/). degree in Detection, Guidance and Control from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, in 2019. I received my [M.Sc](http://m.sc/). degree in Control Theory and Science from Beihang University, Beijing, in 2022. 

**Research interest**

My research interests include multi-agent systems, adaptive control, and event-triggered control. I am more interested in topology identification for complex networks and sythesis of topology identification and control for complex networks.
